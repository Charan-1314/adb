To use the ftp we need vsftpd software
To install it in linux ,enter the command(apt install vsftpd)
To check the vsftpd is added or not ,enetr the command(service --status-all)
to start ftp,enter the command (systemctl start vsftpd)
To connect the ftp server,open the terminal and enter (ftp <yourip>) by default the anonymous user is disabled
To enable the anonymous user go the path "cd /ect/" open the file vsftpd.conf
now you can need to enable the anonymous login to yes
To add the custom path ,you need to type new line below (anon_root="your custom path") 
By default the root user ids blocked
