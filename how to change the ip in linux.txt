sudo ip addr del <your ip/subnet> dev wlan0 or eth0 #it will delete the ip address 
(eg:sudo ip addr del 192.168.43.150/24 dev wlan0)
sudo ip addr add <your ip/subnet> dev wlan0 or eth0 #it will add the new ip address 
(eg:sudo ip addr add 192.168.43.2/24 dev wlan0)
i.e:go and check your routing it was empty ,to check type(route)
#it will only added the subnet not your gateway to add that
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.43.1 #this will add your defaul gateway
#now you can check your ip address by using ifconfig or ip addr
